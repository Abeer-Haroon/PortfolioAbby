			 <p>My name is Abeer Haroon and I am a Developer Advocate at IBM, I recently completed my bachelors degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Wollongong in Dubai. In my university, I have worked on various projects, which mostly involved hardware and software development and integration. One of them was building a smart-bin which uses sensors and visual recognition to identify objects and classify them accordingly for recycling companies. My final year was making a high performance, programmable platform for audio video interactive systems using a complex board called FPGA. At IBM, I have been an active member with my team starting with GITEX 2018 where I was demonstrating the TJBot, which is a robot that uses Watson AI services. I was also managing the social media posts during the event since I love photography.</p>
